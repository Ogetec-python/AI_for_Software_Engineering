# AI in Software Engineering 💻🤖

This repository contains the practical code submissions for the "Building Intelligent Software Solutions" assignment. It demonstrates the application of AI in software engineering through automated testing, AI-powered code generation, and predictive machine learning.

The full theoretical analysis, ethical reflections, and screenshots of these scripts in action are available in our final PDF report.

## Contents

This repository includes the following three practical tasks:

* **`task_1_code_completion.py`**: A Python script comparing a manually-written function (for sorting a list of dictionaries) with an AI-generated version, including a performance analysis.
* **`task_2_automated_testing.py`**: A robust automated testing framework built with Python and Selenium WebDriver. It tests a login page for valid, invalid, and empty credentials using best practices like explicit waits.
* **`task_3_predictive_model.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook (for Google Colab) that demonstrates building a predictive model. It uses a Random Forest Classifier on the Scikit-learn breast cancer dataset, cleverly adapting the binary target into a synthetic 3-class "priority" (High, Medium, Low) to meet the assignment's goals.
